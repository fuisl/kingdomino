- Init project with gdx-liftoff template.

[20.12.2024]

- Add basic component struct.
- Don't know how to setup the project with the ECS pattern.
- in the validator, implemented Observer pattern to update min max.
- x and y reverse
- bug in the validator, the min max is not validated correctly. Basically min max for one axis but using && is count for both axis.

- I will be following this [method](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/351727/working-on-a-branch-with-a-dependence-on-another-branch-that-is-being-reviewed) found on StackOverflow to continue working while waiting for my friend to check my PR.
- I feel like I didn't really follow the ECS pattern. I will try to refactor the code (later) to follow the pattern. It seems that the classes are tightly coupled. But I don't know.
- I need to learn how to use interfaces in Java. I think it will help me to decouple the classes.
- I attempted to refactor the code to follow the ECS pattern. But I don't know if I did it correctly. I will ask my friend to check it.

- refactoring this mess.
- I could try using throw and catch exception to communicate between classes (maybe).

- Following Event-Driven Architecture to decouple the classes. This is found in other based code and at is implemented at the core of LibGDX.
- Framerate Dependence.
- I "accidentally" write my own game engine.

- Happy New Year.
- gotta be really careful about local variable and passing objects around.
- I'm suck at memory management.
